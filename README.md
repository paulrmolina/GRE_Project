# GRE_Project
The final project for my Introduction to Data Mining class, we tasked ourselves with finding a pattern between the expected answer for a GRE question and the lexicon used.

The project was written completely in Python. I was in charge of creating the main script which analyzed the data. Erik was in charge of data extraction and cleansing. Erik handled the final visualization of the data as well.

##
Through this project we determined that a GRE question containing the 4-Gram "What is the value" will produce the answer B with a confidence of 47.62% and that the 4-gram "which of the following" will produce the answer C with a 36.59% confidence.
